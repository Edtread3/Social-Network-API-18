# Social-Network-API-18

 ## Description:   
  In this application I'll practice my skills on creating an API for creating, updating, adding, and 
deleting data for a Social Network app, using NoSQL database. I will build an API for a social network app
where the users can share their thoughts, react to friends and their thoughts, and even create a friends list.

## Tools:
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Mongoose
- MongoDB
- Insomnia

## What I learned:
- How to use NoSQL db when dealing with unstructered data.
- How to build an API using Node.js and Mongoose.
- How to use Node.js and express.js for server and routes for app.
- How to implement endpoints to add and delete friends and data from friends list.
- How to use Insomnia to test the api endpoints.
